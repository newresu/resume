              My primary contribution was to refactor and train a Chemical Variational Auto-Encoder
              (CVAE), that encodes molecules into vectors.
              The neural network was trained in a <abbr>HPCC</abbr> (High Performance Computing Cluster).
              Functionality was added to run this project in a web browser. The code is private due to licensing, but the reference work (unmaintained) project can be found
              at <a href="https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/chemical_vae">aspuru-guzik-group/chemical_vae</a>.

              After a brief period, I realise that this role was not a good fit for me,
              primarily due to my limited experience with Robotics.
              I decided to leave the role and take some time off, during which I implemented the paper "TNT: A Solver for Large Dense Least-Squares Problems that Takes Conjugate Gradient from Bad in Theory, to Good in Practice"
              in Typescript. The code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/newresu/fit-tnt">newresu/fit-tnt</a>.

              For the application to this job, I made a brief video-presentation that summarises most of my work. The presentation is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpUzwnJ1Ka0">on Youtube</a>.

              My role involved
              writing binary data parsers for NMR data. For example, a Varian
              Converter to parse (Varian/Agilent) data.

              This project involved several interesting challenges:
              <ol className="image-tasks">
                <li>Creating a database of IDs,</li>
                <li>Augmenting and cleaning the data,</li>
                <li>Fine tune neural networks to remove signatures, faces and barcodes,</li>
                <li>Compress models to a minimum (2 Mb) to reduce the loading time,
                </li>
                <li>New classification networks in PyTorch (from scratch), to fix the perspective of the ID card automatically.
